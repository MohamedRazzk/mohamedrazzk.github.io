## Inroduction

>  Qiwi-Infosec - Crypto 100_1 cipher text need to be decoded to read the secret message . 

## Description

We got a cipher text that was five lines long and consisted of underscores and numbers from 1 to 5.

## Chipher Text

The following cipher was given:

 ```cpp

 52112515_4535_331534
 442315_321144422453_231143_543445
 213431313452_442315_5223244415_411112122444
 2533341325_2533341325_331534
 442315_21311122_2443_442315_4423244214_31243315

 ```
 
## Solution

By trying a lot of different decoders eventually found that this is a `Polybius-Cipher` , Using [Cryptii Polybius square ](https://cryptii.com/pipes/polybius-square) as web based decoding web or you can use pyhton script that i wrote 

### Python decoding funcation 

The original square [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polybius_square) is as follows:

| | 1   | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | a | b | c | d | e |
| **2** | f | g | h |i/j| k |
| **3** | l | m | n | o | p |
| **4** | q | r | s | t | u |
| **5** | v | w | x | y | z |

Each character is presented with two numbers. The first number shows the row and the second number shows the column of the character.


```python
ciphers = ['52112515_4535_331534',
'442315_321144422453_231143_543445',
'213431313452_442315_5223244415_411112122444',
'2533341325_2533341325_331534',
'442315_21311122_2443_442315_4423244214_31243315']

matrix = [['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'],
['f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'k'],
['l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p'],
['q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u'],
['v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']]

plain = []

for c in ciphers:
words = c.split('_')
for word in words:
for num in range(0, len(word), 2):
y = int(word[num])
x = int(word[num + 1])
plain.append(matrix[y - 1][x - 1])

plain.append('_')
plain[len(plain) - 1] = '\n'

print ''.join(plain)
```

` Cypher Texg is  `  
```cpp 
WAKE_UP_NEO
THE_MATRIX_HAS_YOU
FOLLOW_THE_WHITE_QABBIT
KNOCK_KNOCK_NEO
THE_FLAG_IS_THE_THIRD_LINE
```
` Flag is Captured ` >>> `FOLLOW_THE_WHITE_QABBIT`
